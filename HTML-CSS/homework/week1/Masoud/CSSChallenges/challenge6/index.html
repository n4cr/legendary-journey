            Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental
            states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest
            interpersonal affection and to the simplest pleasure. An example of
            this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the
            love of a spouse, which differs from the love of food. Most
            commonly, love refers to a feeling of strong attraction and
            emotional attachment.

            Love is considered to be a positive and negative: with its virtue
            representing human kindness, compassion, and affection, as "the
            unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another"; and
            its vice representing human moral flaw, akin to vanity, selfishness,
            amour-propre, and egotism, as it potentially leads people into a
            type of mania, obsessiveness or codependency. It may also describe
            compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's
            self or animals. In its various forms, love acts as a major
            facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central
            psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the
            creative arts. Love has been postulated to be a function to keep
            human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the
            continuation of the species.
